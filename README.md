# observer-design-pattern
I think a lot of people will agree with me that the ‘Observer’ Design Pattern is one of the easiest design patterns of them all.
I mean, unlike most of the other design patterns, you can at least ‘Feel’ what is the main concept of the Observer design pattern
by the first read.

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject,
maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, 
usually by calling one of their methods.
See, even the Wikipedia definition is not that hard, right? If you are still struggling, let’s explain it in layman’s term.

Let’s assume that you are searching for a job as a software engineer and very interested in a company named ‘Banana Inc.’. 
So, you contacted their Hiring Manager and gave him your contact number. He ensured you that if there is any vacancy they 
will let you know. And there are several other candidates interested too, like you. 
They will let all of the candidates know about the vacancy and maybe if you respond then they will conduct an interview.
So, how is this scenario related to ‘Observer’ design pattern? Here, the company ‘Banana Inc.’ 
is the Subject which is maintaining a list of all the Observers (candidates like you) and will notify the observers 
for a certain event ‘vacancy’. Ain’t it easy, mate?


Observer design pattern (A bird’s eye view :P)
So, if you ever need to implement this scenario in some software or application you can follow this process and can 
say that you have implemented ‘Observer Design Pattern’. (I’m not bloating my article by showing any code example,
because there are tons of example available at the mighty Internet)
